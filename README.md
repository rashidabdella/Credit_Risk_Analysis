# Credit_Risk_Analysis

## Overview: Explain the Purpose of Analysis

The goal of the analysis is to predict credit risk by utilizing machine learning. This analysis takes a look at using models used to predict credit card risk.
    

## Results:

Scores in random sampling:
Recall score is at 0.60 is for high risk and at .68 for low risk.
Precision score is at 0.1 for high risk and at 1 for low risk
Balanced score is .641

Scores in clusters
Recall score is a 061 for high risk and at .45 for low risk
Balanced accuracy is at .647
Precision is at .1 for high risk and 1 for low risk

Scores for SMOTE
Recall Scores is at .60 for high risk and at  .68 for low risk

Precision is at .01 for high risk and 1 for low risk 

Scores for SMOTEENN
Recall score is at .70 for high risk and .55 for low risk
Balanced accuracy is at .639
Precision is at .01 for high risk and 1 for low risk

Scores for Ensemble Classifier
Recall score is at .9 for high risk and .938 for low risk
Precision is at .07 for high and 1 at low risk
Balanced accuracy is at .926



## Summary:

The models all work for determining credit risk. However, some models are more efficient than others. Cluster model had low accuracy. The RF model had the highest precision but overall, these models might not work when predicting credit risk without supplementing other important tools.
